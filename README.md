A command line tool for managing financial investment portfolios written in Rust.

*This project is meant to be the modern successor of my [finance](https://github.com/MarkusZoppelt/finance) repository.*

## Feature List:

- [x] Async quote querying
- [x] JSON format for portfolio position
- [ ] Plot portfolio allocations, performance, etc.
- [ ] Store quote data persistently. (I want to try [SurrealDB](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb))
- [ ] Performance tracking
